This repository contains scripts for downloading, storing and processing data from various meteorological sensors.

[Joint_log_public.py](https://github.com/olegmatsnev/Meteo/blob/master/Joint_log_public.py) downloads and joins together data from all
currently available meteorological sensors for a period of 1 month, writes it to a *.csv file.

[Wind_rose.py](https://github.com/olegmatsnev/Meteo/blob/master/Wind_rose.py) draws a wind rose -- plot showing the directions from which
the strongest and the most frequent winds blew -- based on a data from a *.csv file.
